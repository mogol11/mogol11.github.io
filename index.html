            <p>My name is Ryan Mogol and I'm a student in the Web Design and Programming class at Park School. This is my portfolio of everything I've worked on over the past semester.</p>
            <p>You can find links to every website I've made here, as well as links to my Codepen and Tumblr, where you can find smaller projects and bits of code I've been experimenting with, as well as some writing about different aspects of web design.</p>

                            <p>For this assignment, I had to pick an essay I had already written for another class and turn it into a styled webpage. I chose to use my Spanish project on the movie <span class="italic">Bread and Roses</span>. This website was the first major assignment of this class. This project was valuable for me because while writing the website, I learned a lot about structuring and organazing HTML. It was also good practice for my CSS skills I already had, but I didn't need to learn much <span class="italic">new</span> CSS to make this website work.</p>

                            <h3 class="project_header">Original Portfolio Design</h3>
                            <div><a href="../Portfolio_old1/index.html" target="_blank">Link to first version</a></div>
                            <div><a href="../Portfolio_old2/index.html" target="_blank">Link to version turned in halfway through the semester</a></div>
                            <p>My portfolio was the second assignment I recieved for this class. There were no constraints except that it had to link to my projects, experiments, and writings on Tumblr. This project was pretty much the opposite of the Essay Design project for me; I didn't need to learn much new HTML, but I had to learn a lot more about CSS in order to make my layout work properly. There are a lot of similarities between the first version and the current one (which you're looking at right now,) especially visually, but the current version of the portfolio was rewritten from scratch, so I could integrate new techniques I've learned since writing the original version. Some pieces of code from the original version that would still work with this new version were recycled, however. To look at the source code of my portfolio (or any website,) right click and select "view page source."</p>
                            <p>Between the first version and the version I turned in at the end of the third quarter, there were a few changes. The most noticeable change is probably that the navigation links have been moved to the sidebar, which now scrolls with the page. It was also given a transluscent background, to make it look a little more like it's meant to be there. I changed the way the writing section looks and works a little bit as well. The background was changed from green to translucent, but I also found a way to control what posts appear there. In the original version, every post appeared there; in the second version, only the most recent post I'd tagged as important appeared. For the current version, I decided to get rid of the Tumblr integration, since it limited the ways I could design the page.</p>

                            <p>For this assignment, I had to advertise something worth advertising. The limitations of this project were that I was only allowed to use up to one image (I decided not to use one,) and that I wasn't allowed to use the color green. Anand said that the message can be funny, so I decided to use a quote from one of my favorite video games, <span class="italic">Portal 2</span>. There aren't many differences between the first and final versions of the design. I fixed the centering of the entire page for the second version (I had messed it up in the first version,) as well as lightening the shade of blue used in the citation, to reduce strain on peoples' eyes. This project was much less technical than the others; I wrote the HTML and CSS in only a few minutes. The real challenge here was the design of the layout. I had to find a way to emphasize certain words and give certain phrases different meaning, while still keeping an overall theme to the layout. This was also the first project designed with phone capability in mind from the start.</p>

                            <div><a href="../WikipediaDesign/index.html" target="_blank">Link to project</a></div>
                            <p>The goal of this project was to redesign a Wikipedia article in a way that creates a better reading experience for the reader. Some of the ways I feel I've accomplished this are by increasing the line height (the amout of space between lines) increasing the font size, and decreasing the line length (the amound of horizontal space a line takes up.) I also moved the table of contents to the side, and made it scroll with the page, so that it's always visible, and hid the links that not many users would click, like "page information" within dropdown menus inside the sidebar. I wrote most of the code for my redesign on my own, but I did copy a few bits of code from Wikipedia. I've annotated within the HTML code which sections are copied. The main challenge with this piece was using Javascript. As I designed my new layout, I realized that it wouldn't work unless I added Javascript (it allows the dropdowns to function.) If you take a look, there's not actually much Javascript there, but the challenge was in finding the most efficent way to handle everything that needed to be done. At one point, my Javascript code was over 100 lines, at which point I realized there was a much better way to accomplish what I wanted and rewrote it to be 23 lines, including empty lines for spacing and notes. This was especially valuable because I was able to apply a lot of the same ideas to this portfolio.</p>

                            <p>As far as I can remember, this was the first homework assignment for this class. The assignment was to pick three websites and write about their form and function, and discuss whether they compliment each other well. Looking back at the code, the the HTML seems to be written mostly correctly, and the CSS is correct as well, but very simple. CSS is the language that's used to control the apperance of a webpage, so it's important to learn how to use it effectively.</p>

                                <p>The links above lead to some of my experiments with HTML and CSS, which are the languages web pages are written in. The first two lead to my experimentations with selecting more specific elements of a page; for example, I could affect only paragraphs that follow lists. The third is my work with pseudoclass selectors, which allow me to affect elements of a page when certain conditions are met; for example, I can use pseudoclass selectors to change the color of a link only when the mouse is hovered over it. The fourth link seems to be more work on pseudoclass selectors that I never got back to working on.</p>

                            <p>For this assignment, I randomly chose an adjective and had to use only visual design to make Shakespeare's Sonnet #18 "feel" like that adjective to the reader. I wan't allowed to change the content of the sonnet in any way. My adjective was "annoyed," so the first thing I did was look up a color that's described as "annoyed." I found a website that said orange is an "annoyed" color, so I made my text orange. I chose the font for the header because the little lines sticking out made it seem like an annoyed person with a shaking hand was writing it. The font that the main body of text is written in made me think of a fat, annoyed businessman writing an annoyed letter, so I also used a papery background to go with that feeling. Overall I feel like I did an alright job of conveying the "annoyed" feeling in this assignment.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the thrid quarter, I was given the assignment of creating a website that serves as a self-evaluation. I also took it as an opportunity to show some of my CSS skills I'd developed by then. There's not really much more to say about this one.</p>

                            <p>For this assignment, I had to create three pairings of one header font and one main body font. Each pairing was supposed to have a different feeling to it. The first pair uses Audiowide as the header font and Michroma as the body font. I think these two fonts together have a futuristic, sci-fi sort of feeling. The second pairing consisted of Germania One for the header font and Della Respira for the body font. These two fonts together have a sort of gothic feel to them. I wanted the thrid pairing to look like something fancy, like an invitation, so I used Condiment as the header font and Inika for the body. I think the three pairings I chose were each able to create a different feel, even though there was no actual content.</p>

                            <p>For this assignment, the class was told to create a layout on paper using only a few black rectangles. The rectangles were of different sizes and were supposed to be positioned so that they would have certain levels of importance on the page. Then, we turned these layouts on paper into web layouts, and used them as a way to experiment with allowing greater flexibility in the size of web browser windows using percentage-based sized and media queries, which cause certain effects to only apply under certain conditions.</p>

                            <p>In class, Anand taught us a little bit about jQuery, which is a collection of functions that can be added to Javascript for web development. For homework the next night, we had to play around with the code he showed us in class and try to learn something new about jQuery. I learned how to make objects whose appearance can be toggled sweep into and out of view, rather than just appear and disappear.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">http://store.steampowered.com/</a></p>
                        <p>This website demonstrates good visual hierarchy, since the first thing your eyes are pulled to is the featured deals (the large Ubisoft banner) next, your eyes are drawn to a scrolling list of other featured deals just below this, followed by a spotlight to the right of this. This is due to the sizes of the images relative to each other and their positioning on the page.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="http://www.mrbottles.com/">http://www.mrbottles.com/</a></p>
                        <p>This website demonstrates bad web design, because your eyes are drawn everywhere at once, and it's hard to tell what you should be focusing on. You've got the colorful picture of the bottles at the top of the page, but then you've got the red text that pops out among the (barely legible) blue text. As soon as the slideshow changes, your eyes are drawn there too. But the worst (read: best) part of the website is that when you load the page, good old Mr. Bottles himself pops out of nowhere and starts going on about his bottle collection (an impressive one, may I add,) and shows off his impressive magic skills by summoning bottles out of nowhere. Not only do the sound and movement immediately distract you from whatever else you may have been focused on, but Mr. Bottles seems to have decided his lecture is more important than the actual content of the page, seeing as he covers up the text and images in the bottom left corner, which you can't read again until he's done talking about his magnificent bottle collection. On the plus side, this website did make me laugh.</p>

                        <p>I love how clean and simple this website looks. It&#8217;s clear that the boxes are links to take you to various pages, not only because their color is different from that of the background, but also because when you mouse over them, they change color. My favorite part of this website&#8217;s design is the grid of links under the &#8220;External References&#8221; header. It manages to fit a lot of links into a small space without looking cluttered or messy. </p>

                        <p><a href="http://academics.parkschool.net/WebDesign/Max/home/main.html">Link</a></p>
                        <p>I wasn't really sure how long this was supposed to be, so I just wrote my thoughts about each page of the portfolio.</p>
                        <p>The first things on the front page that catch my eye are the colorful words that say "Max Strome." I think that this is where the eye should be drawn first, and I like the font and colors used, but looking at the page as a whole, I feel like maybe these words should be a little bigger; it just feels a little too small since it's actually smaller than one section of the drop-down menu. I like the background a lot, since it's interesting without being too distracting. I liked the idea of having a navigation bar with drop-down menus, and I feel that the orange color of the links works well with both the normal black background, as well as the blue that the background changes to when the link is hovered over, but maybe the category that says "cool" should be changed to say "cool links," because to me just seeing the word "cool" was confusing, and adding the word "links" would clarify that under this heading, there are links that you think are cool.</p>
                        <p>On the "Code" page, I like the two lines that help draw your attention to the center of the page, though I feel like you may want to add a large &lt;h1&gt; to the top of the page; to me, not having some sort of large text or title at the top of the page feels like there's something missing. I also feel like you should make the links on this page (only slightly) larger, since I have a hard time distinguishing the links from the descriptions at first glance.</p>
                        <p>The "Me" link under "Bio" doesn't work at school (it's blocked,) and it puts you through a redirect notice before you can access it. This isn't actually a problem with your website's design, but I still feel like you should fix it. On the other hand, I really like the "Bio" page under the "Bio" link. The only criticism I can think of is that you might have a little too much empty space around the text within the box, which you could probably solve by making the text a little bit bigger, or maybe even filling up the empty space with pictures.</p>
                        <p>Overall, I really like the design of this portfolio; there's just a few small things that I think you might want to change around.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="project_header">Critique of Jess' Portfolio</h3>
                        <p><a href="http://academics.parkschool.net/WebDesign/Jess/Student%20Page/index_2.html">Link</a></p>
                        <p>On the welcome page, I like the bright blue background and the dark blue you used for your name, because they seem to fit with the feel of the website that the font helps create. In class, some people mentioned removing the overline and underline from the Welcome link. I don't think this is a bad idea, but if you want to keep the lines, I think it would look good if you made the overline and underline the same distances from the text. I have a hard time telling what the sailboat is, so I'd recommend either removing it entirely, or using the entire picture, including the background. The background is probably blue water, which could look nice with the other blues you used. If you do choose to do that, I think you should center the picture.</p>
                        <p>Moving on to the next page, I like the use of the roses as bullet points, since they contrast nicely with the background and stand out well. My recommendations for this page are that you make the links a little bigger, since they feel kind of small compared to everything else, and center the two links, since it feels like there's space for another link over to the right.</p>
                        <p>You said in class you're not done with your Tumblr section, so I'll skip that and move onto the Codepen section. I like the way the links are organized here, but they feel too close to the top of the screen for me. I'd move them down a bit, and maybe add a header to the top of the page so someone doesn't forget what page they're on.</p>
                        <p>Something I noticed with the entire site is that only the "welcome" link is given a non-default font. I think giving your other links different fonts would make them look better, since I don't think Times New Roman (or any serif font) really fits with the theme you seem to be trying to create. In general, I really like the theme you're creating for this website with the color choices as well as most of the font choices, and there's only a couple things that I think you should change to make the rest of the website fall into this theme.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Link</a></p>
                        <p>I've used this website a lot for background images for my websites, so I figured it might make sense to write my first analysis about it.</p>
                        <p>When I first open the website, the first thing I see is the box advertising the Photoshop plugin, since the background of the page is very light and this box is dark. It also helps that it's so high up on the page. As someone who doesn't use Photoshop, (MS Paint ftw) this annoys me a little, but at least it's nice looking, unlike some online ads I've seen. Though&nbsp;<em>I&nbsp;</em>personally don't care about the plugin, it makes a lot of sense for them to make this the first thing to catch the viewer's eye, since they get $12 whenever someone buys the plugin.</p>
                        <p>One of my favorite features of this website is that you can click any pattern and it will become the background image for the website. This allows you to see how the pattern will look as a background for a page without downloading it and linking it in your CSS, which, for me, has been very useful. This is kind of a nitpicky complaint, but I feel like there are just a few too many patterns listed on one page. I just feel like I'm scrolling a little bit too far to reach the bottom of the page, and I would prefer it if there were either less patterns per page, or if the page was infinitely scrolling, because at least that way I wouldn't be expecting to reach the bottom.</p>
                        <p>The navigation bar at the top is easily visible, but not too obtrusive. It's not difficult to read any of the words on it, even though the darkest color in it is a fairly light green. I like that rather than making a button that says "home" in the nav bar, they used the website's symbol and made it green, because this makes it stand out more from the rest of the buttons on the bar. I like how the bar scrolls with the page so it's easy to click any of the links on it at any time or search for a pattern. Speaking of searching, I've used the search bar a few times and haven't actually found it that useful, but I suspect that's more a problem with the names of the patterns than anything, since they're not always accurately named. (The "Skulls" pattern lacks even a single skull.) I also like how the nav bar is only slightly transparent. It feels more like a cloudy glass window than just a bar sitting at the top of the page, because you can see just the outlines of boxes behind it, but not much more than that.</p>
                        <p>One thing I've noticed that annoys me is that there's this mysterious white box that appears in the lower right-hand corner of the page, and it doesn't seem to do anything. I don't know if this is a problem with the page itself or if it might have something to do with my monitor's fairly small resolution (1366 x 768) but regardless of the source of the problem, it should probably be fixed, since if it's got to do with my monitor size, that's a problem with the fluidity of the site, and if it doesn't, then it's still a problem.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of fluidity, this website handles it okay in my opinion. The page just gives up empty space around the content as you shrink it, at least until it gets smaller than about 1000 pixels. After that, you just get a horizontal scroll bar. This is definitely not the best way to handle small window sizes in my opinion. Those previews of patterns are pretty big, and while they look nice when you have the browser space for them, I doubt anyone would be upset if they got a little smaller when the browser gets smaller for the sake of fluidity.</p>
                        <p>I also looked at the website using iPhone 5 emulation, and there doesn't seem to be a mobile version. When you think about it, this does kind of make sense, given the purpose of the website (you probably don't decide on backgrounds for your websites using your 640 pixel wide phone,) but if one <em>did&nbsp;</em>want to use the website on their phone, it wouldn't really be possible. The navigation bar cuts off halfway through the word "About," and due to its fixed positioning, scrolling horizontally doesn't scroll the bar, meaning the search bar isn't accessible. The ad on the page also blocks the descriptions of the patterns, so it's hard to read about or look at them. (I think a real iPhone might display this ad differently, however.)</p>
                        <p>The font used on the page is a simple sans-serif font (Open Sans) and it's easily readable. It fits well with the somewhat minimalistic style of the page.</p>
                        <p>All in all, I like the design of the Subtle Patterns website. My main problem with it is that it lacks much fluidity, especially since it doesn't seem like a particularly difficult problem to fix (just shrink the preview patterns,) but it's got a lot of nice features too. I love how you can click a pattern to preview it, as well as the font choice. Subtle Patterns is a nice looking website so long as you keep your horizontal browser size above 1000 pixels.</p>
